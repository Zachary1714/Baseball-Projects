```{r Load in Data}
org_batting <- read.csv("Batting.csv")      #Table containing hitting statistics
org_people <- read.csv("People.csv")          #Table containing birthdays
org_appearance <- read.csv("Appearances.csv") #Table containing games played in
org_ranking <- read_xlsx("historic_prospect_ranking_with_Lahman_ID.xlsx")

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
